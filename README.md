# SolitaireJS

## What is this?

Simple browser-based solitaire, developed in a bout of frustration when I couldn't easily find a no-fluff, no-ads solitaire to play.

You can play a complete game in the page, with single-draw and infinite redraw rules. There is no undo, so be careful! Refresh the page for a new deal.

## Secret Features

I also experimented with developing a bot to win solitaire games. It's not very good at it! But if you're interested in trying it, open up the dev console and use the command `bot.autoPlay()` to see it attempt to finish your current game.

You can also use `bot.testRuns()` to attempt to play 100 games and report its win rate. Note that this takes a few minutes.
